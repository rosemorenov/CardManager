# CardManager

Project Name:

Trading Card Collection Manager

What it does:

Lets the user manage a collection of trading cards (like your Avatar set).

Cards are stored in a database (SQLite or SQL Server LocalDB).

User can:

View all cards in a list/grid.

Add a new card.

Edit an existing card.

Delete a card.

Create decks and add/remove cards from them.

See simple stats (total cards, total value, etc.).

This fits really well with variables, lists, loops, decisions, OOP, a GUI, and a database.
